In this project I'm building a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

### Workplace setup

Created new repository for this project called `web-scraping-challenge`.

Cloned the new repository to your computer.

All web scrapping related notebook files, images and app are located in the following folder: `Missions_to_Mars`.

## Step 1 - Scraping

Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

* Create a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb` and use this to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what you need to scrape.
